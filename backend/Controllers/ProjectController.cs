My classroom is a self-contained classroom for students with moderate to severe disabilities. My students range in age from 14 years to 21 years old. We currently have a student population of 15 students with diverse learning needs – working on functional academics, adaptive/life tasks, social skills, transition skills for adult living, and job training. My students have the constant need for movement and could use adaptive seating to focus their attention on learning tasks! Balance Ball Chairs and Adaptive Stools will help meet the diverse learning needs of my students. They will also help motivate my students to work at a table and accomplish their learning tasks, as they’re getting sensory input from their chairs. My students will be able to increase their time on task when their bodies are busy and their brains free from stress. Classroom learning often involves sitting for long periods of time. Too much sitting can lead to back and hip soreness, fatigue, and a lack of focus/time on task. Adaptive seating can remedy these issues! Balance Ball Chairs and Adaptive Stools keep the body engaged and in movement. Research has shown that being able to provide these types of seating options can improve posture/muscle tone, provide sensory input, burn excess energy, and increase blood flow. The Balance Ball Chairs and Adaptive Stools will be used during academic rotations. Another added benefit to using Balance Ball Chairs and Adaptive Stools is reductions in negative behaviors. When students get restless or are bored in the classroom, they will act out. Adaptive seating gives students a productive way to address their behavior needs without causing trouble for themselves or anyone around them.", GoalReached = false, TeacherId = 18, SchoolId = 16 });

Many of my students come from underprivileged homes. Many will most likely not complete college due to the financial burden it imposes. Therefore, I’m trying to teach my students the skills to follow that alternative path. The students who come through my Energy and Power classes are the future engineers and technicians that will be creating and operating the systems that keep our lights on and our cars running. They are being trained in the many different fields of Energy and Power, being exposed to a wide variety of technologies that are being used in the workforce with lessons including renewable energies like biofuels, solar panels, and wind power. Students also do basic programming and build small electrical circuits, we even work with small engines! We focus on how things work, how to fix them, and how to make them more efficient. Due to our High School being an Engineering Academy, many of the students are working in classes that work collaboratively across many different subjects. By adding the Raspberry Pi Bulletin Board in our school, students will be able to see what is happening in not just our class, but also what is taking place across the school at a glance. Students will be able to see due dates, upcoming assessments, and events like visiting speakers or project presentations, a collage of student photos, and important school announcements. The Raspberry Pi can be incorporated into class projects as well. Students will be able to edit the bulletin board so it will display the events and announcements. They will also use appropriate probes and sensors with the raspberry pi to collect and display data such as the local temperature and weather conditions.", GoalReached = false, TeacherId = 19, SchoolId = 17 });

My student, who eats dried fish and moose heart, was afraid of a vegetable. Here in an Alaskan village, school looks a bit different. Each school day starts with a walk or an ATV ride, many students wake up and walk up all on their own while parents are still sleeping. The lunch and breakfast that the school serves will be the most food some of these children will eat all day. During Reading, at least 3 will be falling asleep because their baby brother/sister cried all night in the one bedroom the family shares. At least 2 will be falling asleep because some family member was drinking all night in the house. These students live in a whole different context than most of the U.S., and I have learned so much from them. They may not know what sounds farm animals make, but they can call geese or a moose with incredible accuracy. They might struggle with reading, but they can speak Yup'ik with their grandparents. Because of these kids, I have the best job. For my Native Alaskan students, sitting in a chair all day does not come naturally. When not in school, my students are hardly sitting still. They are playing on the playground, taking part in hunting/fishing trips, camping, hauling wood, taking care of younger siblings, and picking berries. Many of my students choose to stand at their desks during lessons, but our desks cannot be adjusted to be taller. Those students then end up hunched over doing work, or end up kneeling on the floor. Because every person is unique, I want my students to have a choice of how they do their work. If you looked in my classroom during independent activities, you would see students all over the room. Some like clipboards on the floor, others like desks, some prefer a big table, while others like to stand. By having these standing desks as an option, the students will be be able to focus on the tasks they are working on, without the distraction of discomfort. In an Alaskan village school, specialty items like standing desks are hard to get. When the school budget needs to include things like airfare, fuel, and shipping costs for materials and maintenance, there is not many funds left over. With standing desks, the students will have one more tool to be successful.", GoalReached = false, TeacherId = 20, SchoolId = 18 });

These vests will help keep students safe and visible. As a teacher in a low-income/high poverty school district, my students are faced with several challenges both in and out of the classroom. Despite the many challenges they face, I am looking to provide my students with creative and meaningful learning experiences. As well as creating a safe place in which they feel confident, successful, and important. We try to provide opportunities and experiences that most students may never get a chance to see or do. Many of them are being raised in single parent or other guardian households and receive a free lunch. From the minute they walk in the door of my classroom, I focus on their potential and growth while they are with me. I may not be able to control their home lives; however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learners to continue on a path of academic excellence. These vests will help students feel safe and a part of a whole school. These vests will help keep students safe and visible. Students in Kindergarten will be able to use these safety vests year after year on class field trips. These vests will help three Kindergarten classrooms. Students wearing safety vests can be easily seen and kept safe while outside the school.

Please consider helping us out! This student-led project is led by students of Math and Physics - Matthewos, Raymond, and Arecely. They want to volunteer ways to improve our school's computer learning area. Please consider helping us out! My students graduated from the same elementary school. Over 75% of our students knew each other for over five years. As a result, they know each other really well and get along with each other really well. This is rare because we are an inner city school in Boston, where mobility rate is extremely high. Our students respect each other and we are so grateful for everything that is happening in our school every day. As a Title 1 city school, we are proud to say that our attendance is above 90% on average. Occasionally, our 10th graders will reach a 97% attendance. That's an A+! Academically, they are outstanding! They strive to work for good grades. In the last term of SY16, over 80% of our eighth graders were Honorable Mention or above. My students and my school are amazing. They motivate me to be a good teacher and continue to reach out for additional resource for them! Please consider helping us! My students will develop a variety of skills through this project that will prepare them for college and their careers. Some important skills that they will learn via the computer using the cable are Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, AutoCAD, and 123D Design that potentially pave the road for them to become potential graphic designers and/or engineers. More importantly, using these tools and the calculators can help them build creativity digitally. They would also like to get some Expo markers for the classroom for drawing, solving problem in writing, and brainstorming on the board. They want to make this resource accessible to their peers for learning. They would like to reach out to you for your help to make learning more accessible to their fellow classmates. The markers also allow their fellow classmates to read off the board easier since some students cannot read other colors all that well. Thank you for your consideration on helping them to solve these problems. We are so excited to share the two goals we are trying to accomplish in this project: (1) We are trying to get replacement cables to connect our computers to learn Photoshop, CAD, and other really cool drawing programs, (2) calculators to help us with our math skills, and (3) we are trying to get more Expo markers so we can make the things written on the board more readable for all our friends. It will be great if you can help us achieve these goals. We will make the most out of this opportunity by bringing this project to our family and friends' attention so that we can get their support. We will share this project with our network on Facebook and Twitter so that this project can come to life more quickly! We will tell our friends to spread the word and give them props in the hallway time or during an appropriate time in school where we will not interrupt our learning. Thank you so much for your help! This is an important project to us and our school community, because it solves the problem of readability on the board, and it also solves the problem of providing equal learning opportunity to all as we try to learn digital art/engineering skills as well as using calculators. We know that getting a few calculators, cables, and markers are not going to solve our problem immediately, but we know that change takes time and small steps. If we can get one step closer, we will be happy about it! Thank you for your support! You guys are awesome!", GoalReached = false, TeacherId = 22, SchoolId = 20 });
